<p>Did you know that popsicles were invented by accident? In 1905, 11-year-old Frank Epperson left a mixture of powdered soda, water, and a stick in a cup outside overnight. When he woke up the next morning, he found that the mixture had frozen and that he could remove it from the cup by sucking on the stick. Epperson called his invention the "Epsicle," and it eventually became known as the popsicle.</mark></p>
